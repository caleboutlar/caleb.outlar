        "The venerable for loop is a main stay of computer programming, but in python it holds extra functionality that is not always required. In many applications what is really desired is to take a list of items and create another list with the items transformed or filtered in some way. Python has a specific pattern for this type of transformation called a list comprehension. List comprehensions have benefits over for loops in that they are expressions, as opposed to statements, which means they are faster in many cases. Consider this article from 2004 on [efficient string concatenation][python-string-concat] which compares the speed of using several solutions. The trade off is that you lose control flow abilities such as `break` and `continue`, but most of the use cases for these can also be included in a list comprehension using its `if` clause. Here is an example of a list comprehension computing all the even squares less than 100:\n",
